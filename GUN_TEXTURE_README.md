# Gun Texture Feature Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Game Structure
- Added `void *gun` pointer to the `t_cup` structure in `cub.h` to store the gun texture

### 2. Gun Texture Loading
- Implemented `load_gun_texture()` function that loads the gun texture from `textures/gun.xpm`
- Added error handling for texture loading failures
- Gun texture is loaded during game initialization

### 3. Gun Rendering
- Implemented `draw_gun()` function that renders the gun as a HUD overlay
- Gun is positioned in the bottom-right corner with margins (64x64 pixels)
- Gun is rendered as an overlay after the main 3D scene

### 4. Integration Points
- Gun texture loading is called during `game_init()`
- Gun rendering is called after every scene render in:
  - Player movement functions (`ft_up`, `ft_down`, `ft_left`, `ft_right`)
  - Camera rotation (arrow key handlers)
  - Initial scene render in `main()`

### 5. Gun Texture Asset
- Created a 64x64 pixel XPM gun texture at `textures/gun.xpm`
- Simple design with basic gun shape using grayscale colors

## How It Works

The gun texture is implemented as a 2D HUD overlay that:
1. Loads at game startup
2. Renders after each 3D scene update
3. Appears consistently in the bottom-right corner
4. Provides a first-person shooter visual element

## Usage

The gun will automatically appear when the game runs, positioned as a HUD element. It will be visible during all player movements and camera rotations, simulating a first-person view with a weapon ready.

## Technical Details
- Gun texture: 64x64 pixels, 4 colors (black, dark gray, medium gray, light gray)
- Rendered using `mlx_put_image_to_window()` as an overlay
- Position: WIDTH - 114 pixels from left, HEIGHT - 114 pixels from top
